After my experience in the Fabrik Ta PÃ©pite competition, I decided to pursue the development of my project with the [Statut National Etudiant Entrepreneur (SNEE)](https://www.pepitebretagne.fr/le-snee). It enabled me to meet other project leaders, attend workshops to develop new skills and learn more about the world of entrepreneurship. So, thanks to this opportunity, I had access to support for my project, which enabled me to mature it while developing my skills.
