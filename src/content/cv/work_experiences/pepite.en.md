Based on my experience during the "Fabrik Ta PÃ©pite" challenge, I decided to go on with the development of my project with the [Statut National Etudiant Entrepreneur (SNEE)](https://www.pepitebretagne.fr/le-snee).
This status enabled me to meet other project leaders, attend workshops to develop new skills and learn more about the entrepreneurship world.
This opportunity allowed me to access a specific support on my project to make it grow, while developing my skills.
