**{title} at [ECRIN SYSTEMS](https://ecrin.com)**

This company makes embedded computers and industrial systems used in submarines, boats and helicopters.

I took part in:

- Assembling and wiring electronic components
- Installation of motherboards and integrated screens

It was instructive and rewarding.
