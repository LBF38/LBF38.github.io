**{title} at [AVEVA](https://aveva.com)**

Web development on [AVEVA MES](https://www.aveva.com/fr-fr/products/manufacturing-execution-system/) products such as [AVEVA Work Tasks](https://www.aveva.com/fr-fr/products/work-tasks/).

It was a great opportunity for me to deepen my skills in pure HTML/CSS/JS and to learn SQL stored procedures. The aim of the project was to integrate customer requirements into the AVEVA software. To develop a greater customer experience, it begins with the gathering of essentials information.

This traineeship gave me the opportunity to practice English and Spanish on a daily basis.
