I took part in the Fabrik Ta Pépite competition in Brest with my innovative mobile app project along with two teammates. We were able to refine the idea in order to bring out its innovative aspect.

The objective of the competition was to write a convincing presentation of the innovative project we were supporting. We acquired a lot of knowledge related to entrepreneurship through various workshops given by PEPITE Bretagne and the competition's collaborators.
