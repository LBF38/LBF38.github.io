**Instrumentation and observability studies using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and associated technologies.**

The aim of the internship is to work with the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) standard in order to instrument applications and have a better understanding of how they work.

At the same time, I'm developing my Dev/Ops skills on cloud environments such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[OpenShift](https://openshift.com) deployments and others.

To get familiar with information systems and deployed applications, it's also important to work with the technologies associated with the OpenTelemetry standard and the observability ecosystem, such as [Grafana](https://grafana.org), [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), among others.
