**Instrumentation and observability studies using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) and associated technologies.**

The aim of the internship is to study the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) standard in order to instrument applications and gain a better understanding of how they work.

Combined with this, I'm developing my Dev/Ops skills on cloud environments such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[OpenShift](https://openshift.com) deployments and others.

To get a complete picture of the information systems and applications deployed, it's also important to study the technologies associated with the OpenTelemetry standard and the observability ecosystem, such as [Grafana](https://grafana.org), [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io), among others.
