**{title} at [IMPACT, the ENSTA Bretagne Junior Enterprise](https://www.linkedin.com/company/impactenstab/)**

I spent a year working for IMPACT, the Junior Enterprise of ENSTA Bretagne.

As a sales representative, my aim was to diversify the J.E.'s customers by prospecting new companies in the specialist areas in which the school's students have skills. This corresponds to ENSTA Bretagne's 9 areas of specialisation.

In a few words, being a sales representative at IMPACT means :

- A unique and professionalising experience, both human and rewarding;
- Meetings throughout the year and contact with customers;
- Moments of cohesion with the members of the team.

The job also gave me the opportunity to see a number of projects, discover areas with which I was less familiar and learn more about them. It was a very stimulating job.
