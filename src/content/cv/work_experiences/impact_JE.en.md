**{title} at [IMPACT, the ENSTA Bretagne Junior Enterprise](https://www.linkedin.com/company/impactenstab/)**

My role within the ENSTA Bretagne Junior-Enterprise, IMPACT, as a sales representative, was a valuable experience.

> A [Junior-Entreprise](https://junior-entreprises.com/) is an association with the french law of 1901 managed by students for students, in a setup similar to a firm organization.
> It aims to provide students with practical projects in their field of expertise.

My goal was to diversify the J.E.'s clients while prospecting for new companies in the school's various areas of speciality. ENSTA Bretagne has 9 fields of competence in which students can contribute with their know-how.

In a few words, being a sales representative at IMPACT is :

- A human, enriching and professionalising experience;
- Meetings throughout the year and contact with customers;
- Moments of cohesion with the members of the mandate;

what makes this adventure unique.

The job gave me the opportunity to take part in number of projects and discover areas in which I was less familiar, through a fun and stimulating experience.
