**{title}**

As part of a team of 4 students, we resume a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile application in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)/[Dart](https://dart.dev), converted a [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript) (JS) server to [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) (TS), containerised it ([Docker](https://docker.com)) and automated the deployment.
The aim was to provide a decision-making tool for doctors to help advise patient on their treatments.

> **MVTE** stands for *Maladie Veineuse ThromboEmbolique* in french, i.e. Veinous ThromboEmbolism disease.
> This disease causes a blood clot (thrombus) to form in a vein, which can then migrate and block a pulmonary artery, resulting in a pulmonary embolism.
