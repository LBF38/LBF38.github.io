**{title}**

Personnally, in order to optimize note-taking across multiple device, I developed an Obsidian plugin to integrate some of Syncthing's functionality into the application.

This project requires web development skills, in particular using Typescript and Syncthing's REST API.

See [Github](https://github.com/LBF38/obsidian-syncthing-integration) for the source code.
