**{title}**

Personnally, in order to optimize note-taking across multiple devices, I developed [an Obsidian plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=syncthing-integration) to integrate some of [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)'s functionality into the application.

This project requires web development skills, in particular using [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Syncthing's REST API](https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/rest.html).

See [Github](https://github.com/LBF38/obsidian-syncthing-integration) for the source code.
