**{title}**

During my 3 years at [ENSTA Bretagne](https://ensta-bretagne.fr), I was involved in various projects in addition to the courses.

After a general first year, focusing on mechanics, computer science and applied maths, I chose computer science specialization.

My learned knowledge enabled me to carry out various projects, as well as discover various aspects of development:

- low-level development in C/C++,
- cloud with Dev/Ops practices
- mobile,
- web,
- fullstack (backend/frontend).

Furthermore, I've found a passion for cloud development and Dev/Ops practices.
