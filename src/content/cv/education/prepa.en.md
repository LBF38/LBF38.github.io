I did a PTSI/PT* scientific preparatory course at [La Martinière Monplaisir](https://martiniere-monplaisir.ent.auvergnerhonealpes.fr/). This course focuses on mathematics, physics-chemistry and engineering sciences, among other subjects, in preparation for the national competitive entrance exams for the Grandes Ecoles d'Ingénieurs in France.
