I chose a PTSI/PT* scientific preparatory course at [La Martinière Monplaisir](https://martiniere-monplaisir.ent.auvergnerhonealpes.fr/). This specific one focuses on mathematics, physics-chemistry and engineering sciences, along with other subjects, in preparatory class for major french engineering schools competitive examinations.
